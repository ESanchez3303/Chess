ChessFinal.exe is the final object and program. The myform.h and .cpp are the programing. 
Note: Finished programs have just been uploaded in their final forms. Please reach out for useable code. 
This program was made using Visual Studio and, therefore, depends on many other files. However, with some tweaking, it could be editable again. 

LOOK AT PHOTOS FOR THIS PROJECT. :)
